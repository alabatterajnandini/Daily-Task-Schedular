Daily Task Scheduler

Project Overview

Daily Task Scheduler is a simple Python-based project designed to help users manage their daily tasks.
It allows users to add tasks, set a date and time for each task, and receive a reminder when the scheduled time arrives.

Features
Add new tasks with date and time
Automatic reminder when the time matches
View pending and completed tasks separately
Mark tasks as completed
All data is stored in a JSON file (tasks.json)
Simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly.
How It Works
The program runs through a menu-driven interface in the terminal.
A background thread continuously checks the current date and time.
When it matches a task’s scheduled time, the reminder is displayed on the screen.
The tasks are saved in a JSON file, making the project easy to manage and store without using a database.

2. tasks.json – stores all tasks in JSON format

How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open the project folder
